			<p>Loyal to Moana and despite being a pig, Pua usually acts like a puppy. He would always join Moana on her journeys sailing the seas and try and capture any clownfish along the way. The most bravest amongst his pack, Pua is energetic from dusk to dawn and even recently learned how to swim to visit life underseas himself.</p>
